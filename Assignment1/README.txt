A brief explanation of the files submitted:
1. CipherText.txt: the ciphertext assigned to me;
2. EncrypterDecrypter.py: the program that performs encryption and decryption function;
3. PlainText_Result.txt: the plaintext produced by decrypting the ciphertext in CipherText.txt;
4. Statistics.txt: the statistics of the ciphertext with N=7 (the correct key length);
5. StatisticsAnalyzer.py: the program that display the statistics of the ciphertext for subsequences of one every N characters;
6. Peisen _Hu_ECE458_Lab1_Report.pdf: the lab report.

*To run the programs, just run "python .\EncrypterDecrypter.py" or "python .\StatisticsAnalyzer.py" in the directory.
Also make sure that you have put the ciphertext/plaintext in CipherText.txt/PlainText.txt under the same directory before running the programs.
